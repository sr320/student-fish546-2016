# Annotating the Olympia Oyster Draft Genome
My FISH545 Class Project

I am taking a draft genome and trying to annotate it in terms of genomic features.

### Files and Directories

`data` - Primary fasta files and databases.

`jupyter` - Location of Jupyter notebooks used for analysis. 

`analyses` - Products of analyses carried out in notebooks.

`docs` - Directory with all components of Jekyll-now that allows publishing of _blog_ documenting my progress. **[Check it out](https://sr320.github.io/student-fish546-2016/)**

`scripts` - Perl and shell scripts I commonly use, and routinely include in repos.

`.gitignore` - Files that are on my local machine(s) but not pushed to GitHub (as they are too large)
